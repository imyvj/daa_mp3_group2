# Decrease and Conquer: Binary Search & Russian Multiplication

## Description
This project implements the **Decrease and Conquer** technique by demonstrating two powerful algorithms:
- **Binary Search:** Efficiently finds an element in a sorted array.
- **Russian Multiplication:** A multiplication method that reduces the problem size step by step.

## Features
- Implements **Binary Search** for fast searching.
- Demonstrates **Russian Multiplication** as an alternative multiplication approach.
- Showcases the **Decrease and Conquer** strategy for problem-solving.
